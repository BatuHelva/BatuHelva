Hi, I’m Batu Helvacıoğlu @BatuHelva
I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence.
I’m currently an undergraduate student at Koç University and a Research and  Development Engineer Intern at Yapı Kredi Teknoloji.
My CV and reports of the projects that I have completed can be found here. 
Projects that I can share have their own repositories in my profile.
